# Learning Game Engine programming

This project will track me progress at learning to create a game engine from stratch. This is not original work and I follow a tutorial but I will try to give it my own spin.

# Progress

- [x] Project Init and Library Scouting
- [x] Logging System (spdlog)
- [x] Input System
- [ ] Proper Libary Integration
  - [x] GLFW
  - [x] GLAD
  - [x] Spdlog
  - [ ] GLM (implemented but not in use)
- [ ] Finally Some Rendering
- [ ] More...

# Info

This project is meant to be compiled with msvc no other compilers are tested but I will try to keep the engine compiler agnostic as match as possible. For Windows I think msvc aka visual studio is the best choice for now.
I follow this youtube playlist: [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT)

I will try to learn how to assemble the engine then maybe i will add my own spin on the prossess, for now I will follow the tutorial.

### Sidenote

_The Cherno_ is really good both at writing code and at teaching about it. Give him a follow.
